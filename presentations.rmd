A few times each year I am honored to have the opportunity to give educational presentations to various clubs, societies, and non-profit groups. I have presented to all age groups from small children to advanced retirees! I am always happy to receive these invitations and they can be requests for a presentation on a specific topic or a general request for a talk about “bugs”. Send me an [e-mail](https://karatylerjulian.github.io/contactme.html){tartget="_blank"} if you are interested in having me present a topic for your group, school, or event. My presentations are in the form of powerpoint presentations, though I also enjoy leading nature walks where I point out edible wild plants or interesting insects. You can view my past presentation topics below, as well as some of the powerpoint presentations themselves. Please do not reuse my materials without asking permission first. [E-mail me](https://karatylerjulian.github.io/contactme.html){tartget="_blank"} today and we can discover a good presentation topic and format to best suit your group and theme!
